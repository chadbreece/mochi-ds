# Mochi DS Takehome Submission

Welcome to my submission to this takehome assignment. There's a couple of things you will need to do to test out this code and see it in action.

### Package installation
There is a requirements.txt that lists all the packages needed to run this code, just make sure these are all installed before running!

### Google OAuth credentials
There is an empty credentials.json file that uses a Google Service Account to read and write to a Google Sheets table. To try the full functionality of this code, you need to include the information for your own service account.

### Running the code
Make sure your terminal is in the correct directory (this one, wherever this README is) and run the following line
```
streamlit run mochi-health-takehome.py
```

That's about it, you can interact with the dashboard once this code is running.
